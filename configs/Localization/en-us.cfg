	// Defs for Aklarka:
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_displayName = Aklarka^N
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_description = Aklarka is between a rocky planet and a gas planet, covered in water and a dense hydrogen based atmosphere, it is believed to be the first identified Hycean planet. Its original discoverer thought it was a fly on the lens.
	
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_biomeDisplayName_Aklarka = Aklarka
	
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded1 = How did we get here? // Doesn't have a surface so this is illegal
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded2 = Proxima won't be too happy about this!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed1 = Being a Hycean planet, Aklarka sure has some waves! I hope we don't tip over!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed2 = The water seems to be getting inside every open hole. The engines and RCS are reporting being "thoroughly flooded".
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingLow1 = Flying low over Aklarka sure is a spectacle! The engines don't seem too happy about the hydrogen though.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingLow2 = From this low altitude, we can see the ocean clearly. We may have to circle down over the beacon!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingHigh1 = At this height, we can run experiments on Aklarka's upper atmosphere. Seems to be hydrogen all the way down!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingHigh2 = From up here we can marvel at the planet-wide ocean. This is the first Hycean planet found by kerbals, so the scientists back home are very excited!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow1 = Alarka takes up most of the window. Surface scans indicate waves the size of mountains. Probably a bug.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow2 = The planet looming up is nothing but water. And hydrogen, according to our instruments. We'll have to dip in to make sure!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceHigh1 = From here, Aklarka almost looks like Kerbin, but doesn't have any land. The crew are getting nostalgic.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceHigh2 = After months of travel, we are greeted by our next stop: Aklarka. This appears to be a Hycean planet, however we need to get more information to be sure.

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfLanded1 = Not even Jeb has this level of badassery! // Doesn't have a surface so this is illegal
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfLanded2 = So this is where baby krakens are born!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfSplashed1 = After clambering out of the hatch, we can see that the waves are indeed the size of mountains.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfSplashed2 = GET YOUR ASS BACK INTO THE SHIP NOW!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingLow1 = The EVA suit is loudly complaining about a "Dangerous Atmosphere". I wonder why?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingLow2 = From outside, we can marvel at the ocean stretching out below. The shimmering blue stuns you.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingHigh1 = At this altitude, we really hope that the atmosphere is dense enough to parachute safely
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingHigh2 = The mission planners back at the KSC have marked this maneuver as "Highly dangerous and must not be attemped".
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceLow1 = Getting out here really shows how massive Aklarka truly is, on a kerbal scale. Your entire field-of-view is flled by a lovely shimmering blue.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceLow2 = Mission planners thought that their equipment was malfunctioning, but it really is a planet full of water!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceHigh1 = After entering Aklarka's SOI, we can get a closer view at the lovely Hycean world stretching out below.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceHigh2 = After losing Kerbin, Aklara reminds the crew of their beautiful blue marble.

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded1 = The goo seems to know that this state is illegal // Doesn't have a surface so this is illegal
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded2 = How did you manage this anyway?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfSplashed1 = The goo seems to enjoy the warm, peaceful ocean.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfSplashed2 = This is the first time that kerbals have seen the goo this excited!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingLow1 = When flying, the goo seems to retract back into its casing.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingLow2 = It appears that the goo does not like flying in Aklarka's atmosphere
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingHigh1 = The goo does not like this one bit. Maybe the hydrogen and lack of a stable surface disturbs it?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingHigh2 = Attempts to observe the goo have failed. The goo is really angry here.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow1 = The goo is its familiar self here. It appears that a new planet does not disturb it.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow2 = The goo appears to be curious, looking at the beautiful blue surface below with awe.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceHigh1 = The goo seemed to be in some sort of hibernation, but awoke once it detected Aklarka.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceHigh2 = The goo canister is warm to the touch, compared to the cold metal exterior of the spacecraft. Maybe the goo is happy?

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_srfLanded1 = Temperature indicates negative kelvin. This indicates that this is not a supported situation
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_srfLanded2 = Achievement Unlocked! Breaking The Game!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_srfSplashed1 = Temperature indications say that it is slightly warmer than Kerbin was. Signs of life maybe!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_srfSplashed2 = Huh, the temperature probe indicates that Aklarka's ocean is slightly warmer than Kerbin was. We need more data under the ocean though.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_flyingLow1 = The temperature probe seems to be indicating cold temperatures, but that might just be the wind.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_flyingLow2 = The probe indicates a very warm, habitable temperature.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_flyingHigh1 = The readings seem to jerk about a lot, might be some upper-level winds.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_flyingHigh2 = The temperature probe is responding exactly as the engineers back home expected.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_inSpaceLow1 = Temperatures seem to be normal for a low orbit around a planet!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_inSpaceLow2 = The probe seemed to be indicating a sudden heat. Got us confused before we realised it was Jeb running the snack heater too much.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_inSpaceHigh1 = Measuring the temperature in space is challenging, due to not many particles coming in. We assume that it is cold.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_temperature_inSpaceHigh2 = The temperature probe *says* zero kelvin, we are not sure though.

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_srfLanded1 = Sample indicates illegallity!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_srfLanded2 = Crew onboard are very confused about this sample!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_srfSplashed1 = Ocean sample gatheres seems to indicate a similar water to Kerbin and Laythe. More signs of life?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_srfSplashed2 = The crew are really excited about this sample! It indicates similarity to samples from Kerbin and Laythe, which suggests that Aklarka *might* be another habitable home
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_flyingLow1 = It's called a "surface sample" for a reason
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_flyingLow2 = What are you even expecting from this sample?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_flyingHigh1 = I told you to not read this file, its way more fun to find these out in-game
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_flyingHigh2 = WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE???
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_inSpaceLow1 = Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/rGF5Ge9y7f
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_inSpaceLow2 = What samples did you collect from up here?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_inSpaceHigh1 = It's chilly out here. Why did you send me on this pointless endeavour?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_inSpaceHigh2 = We probably should get this sample from that blue ball down there...

	// Defs for Alia:
	#LOC_CH_Alia_displayName = Alia^N
	#LOC_CH_Alia_description = Alia, the secondary binary planet of the Sanctar-Alia system. A very bumpy yet beautiful crater covered world, perfect for a colonial expansion as it is almost as habitable as Sanctar.

	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_Ocean = Ocean
	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_NorthCap = North Cap
	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_SouthCap = South Cap

	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands
	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_ColdOcean = Cold Ocean


	// Defs for Beekos:
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_displayName = Beekos^N
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_description = Being the second innermost moon of Magnifica makes it a little bit more difficult to reach, its stretched out shape is most likely due to its rotation speed and collecting material from Magnificas rings.
		
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_biomeDisplayName_Highlands = Highlands


	// Defs for Booopus:
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_displayName = Booopus^N
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_description = The discovery of Booopus caused a wave of melancholy in the Kerbal society, its appearance ressembles the Mun, the former moon of the original home of the kerbals, they miss their home.
		
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_MareInferni = Mare Inferni
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_SmallPlain = Small Plains
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_Highlands = Highlands
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_BobCrater = Bob Crater


	// Defs for Cili:
	#LOC_CH_Cili_displayName = Cili^N
	#LOC_CH_Cili_description = Cili is an asteroid captured by Sanctar-Alia, its size is very concerning as it could easily make one of the two worlds unhabitable if perturbed, keeping an eye on it is the best thing to do.

	#LOC_CH_Cili_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Cili_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands
	#LOC_CH_Cili_biomeDisplayName_Highlands = Highlands
	

	// Defs for Dasar:
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_displayName = Dasar^N
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_description = Dasar is the closet planet to Harmonia, so close that some pools of lava has formed, creating sharp edges and flat plains. The lack of craters shows an extremely young surface. It has orgininally been confused by a very dim brown dwarf due to emmiting a considerable amount of light.

	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_LavaLakes = Lava Lakes
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_HotShores = Hot Shores
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_FlatPlains = Flat Plains
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands


	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_HotShore1 = There is quite a lot of perilous terrain all about us, excluding the glowing lakes of molten rock within walking distance. You think this is as close as you should get to them.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_HotShore2 = Setting up in such a location is certainly a daring idea. Best to make sure no equipment rolls into the lava below!	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_Lowlands1 = The terrain is much more uneven here as it leads towards the basin. You hope the volcanic activity doesn't cause a huge fissure to open up and sawallow the craft.	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_Lowlands2 = Although the glimmering rocks around the craft are much more interesting than at higher altitudes, they're probably much too hot to be picked up beside a quick surface sample.	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_Flatplains1 = Thankfully, this region of the planet seems to be the safest. Let's hope it stays that way...
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_Flatplains2 = Although these temperatures are as "cold" as they're going to get landed on this planet, its still swelteringly hot under this space suit!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_Midlands1 = The ground is still quite stable here but some interesting formations and gradients are starting to appear.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded_Midlands2 = The occasional tremor shakes the craft. Thankfully, there's still some distance between you and the hypnotic oceans of lava if something were to break.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed1 = Umm... its a little bit hot.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed2 = Did we pack any radiators?
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_LavaLakes1 = The gentle amber glow from the lava beneath you floods the capsule. It's a sight truly worth coming all this way for, but staring for too long makes your eyes start to water.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_LavaLakes2 = Watching the molten magma slowly twisting in the huge basins below you, it fills you with determination... and a little bit of concern as the heat hits the craft.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_HotShore1 = It's starting to get quite hot now. Let's hope our equipment can handle it!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_HotShore2 = It's much easier to make out the bubbling details of the swirling lava amid the sooty landmasses now. Is that a good thing?
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_Lowlands1 = Harsh cliffs and gradients appear to inhabit this part of the planet. Probably not the safest place to land.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_Lowlands2 = In the distance, you notice a large boulder getting shook loose by the tectonic activity of the planet. It rolls closer to the lava lakes for a short while before getting stuck again in the temporary safety of the jagged terrain. You breathe a quick sigh of relief and return to the mission.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_Midlands1 = A thick layer of dusty ash and loose sediment appears to cover this part of the ground. The craft might be able to land here but it may be risky.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_Midlands2 = The terrain appears mostly flat, but the occasional cliff or mountain appears out of nowhere to disturb this theme.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_FlatPlains1 = Patches of smooth, brown basalt rock finally interrupt the jagged cliffs and layers of loose sediment. They're probably the best place to land.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow_FlatPlains2 = From here, the terrain appears to be as calm as it's going to get. It's saddening that the safest place to land will likely avoid the beautiful view of the lava oceans.

	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_HotShore1 = The goo seems to be a little unconfortable in this sweltering environment. Then again, the crew is quite uncomfortable as well.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_HotShore2 = The heat is getting unbearable for the goo. We should probably get out of here quickly!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_Lowlands1 = The goo seems to enjoy the warmth after so long in the frigid environment of space.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_Lowlands2 = The soot from the ground gets on the canister windows, making it hard to peer inside and observe the goo. From what we can see, it seems to be shuffling around in it's canister
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_Flatplains1 = The goo likes this better than other parts of Dasar. It isn't exactly cold here, but much better than the hot shores.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_Flatplains2 = For a while, it almost seems like the goo is asleep. 
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_Midlands1 = The landing was a bit rough, but the goo doesn't seem to care. It's probably endured so many hard landings that this does not disturb it.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded_Midlands2 = The goo seems to have taken a liking to some of the rocks here. When a scientist brought a rock close to the canister's windows, the goo moved around excitedly.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfSplashed1 = The goo canister is so hot that we cannot observe the goo inside anymore. The goo probably doesn't like it though!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfSplashed2 = The goo canister doesn't have any thermal conditioning, so we probably should get out of here before the canister melts and the goo escapes!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_LavaLakes1 = The goo canister is colder than if it were in lava, however it is still quite warm. The goo doesn't seem to like the intense heat radiating out from Dasar.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_LavaLakes2 = The goo shakes and writhes inside its canister. I think we should get out of here.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_HotShore1 = The goo seems to be ok, for now. Any closer and it might overheat.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_HotShore2 = The canister holding the goo back is getting quite warm. We can't be sure of the goo's temperature inside, however it's probably safe to assume that it does not like it.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_Lowlands1 = The goo seems to enjoy looking down at the sooty surface of Dasar. Over here it's not quite as hot.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_Lowlands2 = Flying near the soot obscures the canister, though not as much as landing. The goo tries to peer out of the windows. We should probably clean them.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_Midlands1 = The goo really has taken a liking to these rocks. It keeps peering out and looking for more rocks.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_Midlands2 = The goo doesn;t want to go away from this place. If we left it here it probably would have the time of it's life looking at these rocks.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_FlatPlains1 = The canister is cold to the touch. The goo definitely enjoys the slight warmth after months of interplanetary travel.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow_FlatPlains2 = The goo seems to be sleeping, again! The scientists have been neglecting all other duties to stare at the goo.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceHigh1 = The goo peers out at Dasar. I think it might enjoy the warmth down there.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceHigh2 = The canister is being slightly warmed by the heat radiating off from Dasar. The goo definitely enjoys the warmth! We might fit small heaters in the next revision of the canister for those long trips.
