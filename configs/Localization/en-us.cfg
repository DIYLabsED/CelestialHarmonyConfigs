	// Defs for Aklarka:
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_displayName = Aklarka^N
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_description = Aklarka is between a rocky planet and a gas planet, covered in water and a dense hydrogen based atmosphere, it is believed to be the first identified Hycean planet. Its original discoverer thought it was a fly on the lens.

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded1 = How did we get here? // Doesn't have a surface so this is illegal
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded2 = Proxima won't be too happy about this!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed1 = Being a Hycean planet, Aklarka sure has some waves! I hope we don't tip over!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed2 = The water seems to be getting inside every open hole. The engines and RCS are reporting being "thoroughly flooded".
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingLow1 = Flying low over Aklarka sure is a spectacle! The engines don't seem too happy about the hydrogen though.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingLow2 = From this low altitude, we can see the ocean clearly. We may have to circle down over the beacon!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingHigh1 = At this height, we can run experiments on Aklarka's upper atmosphere. Seems to be hydrogen all the way down!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_flyingHigh2 = From up here we can marvel at the planet-wide ocean. This is the first Hycean planet found by kerbals, so the scientists back home are very excited!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow1 = Alarka takes up most of the window. Surface scans indicate waves the size of mountains. Probably a bug.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow2 = The planet looming up is nothing but water. And hydrogen, according to our instruments. We'll have to dip in to make sure!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceHigh1 = From here, Aklarka almost looks like Kerbin, but doesn't have any land. The crew are getting nostalgic.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceHigh2 = After months of travel, we are greeted by our next stop: Aklarka. This appears to be a Hycean planet, however we need to get more information to be sure.

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfLanded1 = Not even Jeb has this level of badassery! // Doesn't have a surface so this is illegal
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfLanded2 = So this is where baby krakens are born!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfSplashed1 = After clambering out of the hatch, we can see that the waves are indeed the size of mountains.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_srfSplashed2 = GET YOUR ASS BACK INTO THE SHIP NOW!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingLow1 = The EVA suit is loudly complaining about a "Dangerous Atmosphere". I wonder why?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingLow2 = From outside, we can marvel at the ocean stretching out below. The shimmering blue stuns you.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingHigh1 = At this altitude, we really hope that the atmosphere is dense enough to parachute safely
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_flyingHigh2 = The mission planners back at the KSC have marked this maneuver as "Highly dangerous and must not be attemped".
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceLow1 = Getting out here really shows how massive Aklarka truly is, on a kerbal scale. Your entire field-of-view is flled by a lovely shimmering blue.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceLow2 = Mission planners thought that their equipment was malfunctioning, but it really is a planet full of water!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceHigh1 = After entering Aklarka's SOI, we can get a closer view at the lovely Hycean world stretching out below.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_evaReport_inSpaceHigh2 = After losing Kerbin, Aklara reminds the crew of their beautiful blue marble.

	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded1 = The goo seems to know that this state is illegal // Doesn't have a surface so this is illegal
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfLanded2 = How did you manage this anyway?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfSplashed1 = The goo seems to enjoy the warm, peaceful ocean.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_srfSplashed2 = This is the first time that kerbals have seen the goo this excited!
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingLow1 = When flying, the goo seems to retract back into its casing.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingLow2 = It appears that the goo does not like flying in Aklarka's atmosphere
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingHigh1 = The goo does not like this one bit. Maybe the hydrogen and lack of a stable surface disturbs it?
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_flyingHigh2 = Attempts to observe the goo have failed. The goo is really angry here.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow1 = The goo is its familiar self here. It appears that a new planet does not disturb it.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceLow2 = The goo appears to be curious, looking at the beautiful blue surface below with awe.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceHigh1 = The goo seemed to be in some sort of hibernation, but awoke once it detected Aklarka.
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_ScienceDef_mysteryGoo_inSpaceHigh2 = The goo canister is warm to the touch, compared to the cold metal exterior of the spacecraft. Maybe the goo is happy?

	// Defs for Alia:
	#LOC_CH_Alia_displayName = Alia^N
	#LOC_CH_Alia_description = Alia, the secondary binary planet of the Sanctar-Alia system. A very bumpy yet beautiful crater covered world, perfect for a colonial expansion as it is almost as habitable as Sanctar.


	// Defs for Beekos:
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_displayName = Beekos^N
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_description = Being the second innermost moon of Magnifica makes it a little bit more difficult to reach, its stretched out shape is most likely due to its rotation speed and collecting material from Magnificas rings.
		

	// Defs for Booopus:
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_displayName = Booopus^N
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_description = The discovery of Booopus caused a wave of melancholy in the Kerbal society, its appearance ressembles the Mun, the former moon of the original home of the kerbals, they miss their home.
		

	// Defs for Cili:
	#LOC_CH_Cili_displayName = Cili^N
	#LOC_CH_Cili_description = Cili is an asteroid captured by Sanctar-Alia, its size is very concerning as it could easily make one of the two worlds unhabitable if perturbed, keeping an eye on it is the best thing to do.
		

	// Defs for Dasar:
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_displayName = Dasar^N
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_description = Dasar is the closet planet to Harmonia, so close that some pools of lava has formed, creating sharp edges and flat plains. The lack of craters shows an extremely young surface. It has orgininally been confused by a very dim brown dwarf due to emmiting a considerable amount of light.

		
	// Defs for Eespeyeria:
	#LOC_CH_Eespeyeria_displayName = Eespeyeria^N
	#LOC_CH_Eespeyeria_description = Eespeyeria has a very dense atmopshere for a moon of this mass. Readings show a very eroded landscape with lakes of hydrocarbons.

		
	// Defs for Gaia:
	#LOC_CH_Gaia_displayName = Gaia^N
	#LOC_CH_Gaia_description = Being the outermost body in the Harmonia system, Gaia is famous for its unique properties, a dense enough atomsphere for aerobreaking, an icy composition (perfect for ice cream) and a ressourceful companion, Po.

		
	// Defs for Harmonia:
	#LOC_CH_Harmonia_displayName = Harmonia^N
	#LOC_CH_Harmonia_description = Harmonia is the center of this star system.

		
	// Defs for Kreak:
	#LOC_CH_Kreak_displayName = Kreak^N
	#LOC_CH_Kreak_description = Kreak is an icy moon, so icy that most of its surface is covered in ice, except for some mountains raising above the ice levels. Probably also tastes delicious.

		
	// Defs for Krob:
	#LOC_CH_Krob_displayName = Krob^N
	#LOC_CH_Krob_description = Only true moon of the Sanctar-Alia system, the coloration was originally thought to be ice cream, unfortunately its close proximity to Harmonia makes it impossible.

		
	// Defs for Magnifica:
	#LOC_CH_Magnifica_displayName = Magnifica^N
	#LOC_CH_Magnifica_description = The sole gas giant in the Harmonia system, it was named Magnifica due to the discoverer being completely baffled by the grape candy in the sky.

		
	// Defs for Majesty:
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_displayName = Majesty^N
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_description = Majesty is the only moon of Aklarka. The nature of its parent planet makes Majesty a nice pit stop for whoever tries to go and return from Aklarkas surface. Majesty agglomerate some material in the rings, creating a gap. Jumping from the giant cliff looks very fun !

		
	// Defs for Po:
	#LOC_CH_Po_displayName = Po^N
	#LOC_CH_Po_description = Po is the sole companion of Gaia, together alone at the edge of the system. This time it actually might have ice cream on it!

		
	// Defs for Pobos:
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_displayName = Pobos^N
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_description = Pobos is the innermost moon of Magnifica, it is very small and theorized to be a clump of ring material or being the remnant of an old broken moon that made the rings. Some says that it ressembles a primate skull.
		
	// Defs for Sanctar
	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_displayName = Sanctar^N
	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_description = Sanctar is a very welcoming world, falling upon it is extremely luck as it is apart of a binary system. Its sister, Alia, has very similar properties. Those qualities made Sanctar the number one candidate for kerbal immigration after they lost their home due to unfortunate events.

		
	// Defs for Trom
	#LOC_CH_Trom_displayName = Trom^N
	#LOC_CH_Trom_description = Trom is an egg shaped ringed dwarf planet, its original discovery made the scientists quite hungry for an omelette. Some believe it to be a Kraken egg. Kraken egg or not, Trom is an interesting destination.

	// Defs for Vallheilheim
	#LOC_CH_Vallheilheim_displayName = Vallheilheim^N
	#LOC_CH_Vallheilheim_description = Valheilheim is the desert planet of the Harmonia system. This planet has very small rings and a huge plain, most probably due to a *recent* cataclysmic event, such as a collision. This place would be great to shoot some movies !
