	// Defs for Aklarka:
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_displayName = Aklarka^N
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_description = Aklarka is between a rocky planet and a gas planet, covered in water and a dense hydrogen based atmosphere, it is believed to be the first identified Hycean planet. Its original discoverer thought it was a fly on the lens.
	
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_biomeDisplayName_Aklarka = Aklarka

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// Defs for Alia:
	#LOC_CH_Alia_displayName = Alia^N
	#LOC_CH_Alia_description = Alia, the secondary binary planet of the Sanctar-Alia system. A very bumpy yet beautiful crater covered world, perfect for a colonial expansion as it is almost as habitable as Sanctar.

	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_Ocean = Ocean
	#LOC_CH_Alia_biomeDisplayName_NorthCap = North Cap

	// Defs for Beekos:
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_displayName = Beekos^N
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_description = Being the second innermost moon of Magnifica makes it a little bit more difficult to reach, its stretched out shape is most likely due to its rotation speed and collecting material from Magnificas rings.
		
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_biomeDisplayName_Highlands = Highlands

	// Defs for Booopus:
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_displayName = Booopus^N
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_description = The discovery of Booopus caused a wave of melancholy in the Kerbal society, its appearance ressembles the Mun, the former moon of the original home of the kerbals, they miss their home.
		
	#LOC_CH_Booopus_biomeDisplayName_MareInferni = Mare Inferni

	// Defs for Cili:
	#LOC_CH_Cili_displayName = Cili^N
	#LOC_CH_Cili_description = Cili is an asteroid captured by Sanctar-Alia, its size is very concerning as it could easily make one of the two worlds unhabitable if perturbed, keeping an eye on it is the best thing to do.

	// Note: Dasar was giving me some problems, specifically about biomes. The defs here are placeholders, once the biomes are working they will be removed/modified.

	// Defs for Dasar:
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_displayName = Dasar^N
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_description = Dasar is the closet planet to Harmonia, so close that some pools of lava has formed, creating sharp edges and flat plains. The lack of craters shows an extremely young surface. It has orgininally been confused by a very dim brown dwarf due to emmiting a considerable amount of light.

	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_LavaLakes = Lava Lakes
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_HotShores = Hot Shores
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_BasaltPlateaus = Basalt Plateus
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_CraterMountain = Crater Mountain
		
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded1 = There is quite a lot of perilous terrain all about us, excluding the glowing lakes of molten rock quite close by. You think this is as close as you should get to them.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded2 = Setting up in such a location is certainly a daring idea. Best to make sure no equipment rolls into the lava below!	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded3 = The terrain is much more uneven here as it leads towards the basin. You hope the volcanic activity doesn't cause a huge fissure to open up and sawallow the craft.	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded4 = Although the glimmering rocks around the craft are much more interesting than at higher altitudes, they're probably much too hot to be picked up beside a quick surface sample.	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded5 = Thankfully, this region of the planet seems to be the safest. Let's hope it stays that way...
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded6 = Although these temperatures are as "cold" as they're going to get landed on this planet, its still swelteringly hot under this space suit!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded7 = The ground is still quite stable here but some interesting formations and gradients are starting to appear.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded8 = The occasional tremor shakes the craft. Thankfully, there's still some distance between you and the hypnotic oceans of lava if something were to break.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed1 = Umm... its a little bit hot here. We should probably skedaddle out of here ASAP.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed2 = Did we pack any radiators? Jeb, did you forget the radiators AGAIN?
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow1 = The gentle amber glow from the lava beneath you floods the capsule. It's a sight truly worth coming all this way for, but staring for too long makes your eyes start to water.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow2 = Watching the molten magma slowly twisting in the huge basins below you, it fills you with determination... and a little bit of concern as the heat hits the craft.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow3 = It's starting to get quite hot now. Let's hope our equipment can handle it!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow4 = It's much easier to make out the bubbling details of the swirling lava amid the sooty landmasses now. Is that a good thing?
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow5 = Harsh cliffs and gradients appear to inhabit this part of the planet. Probably not the safest place to land.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow6 = In the distance, you notice a large boulder getting shook loose by the tectonic activity of the planet. It rolls closer to the lava lakes for a short while before getting stuck again in the temporary safety of the jagged terrain. You breathe a quick sigh of relief and return to the mission.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow7 = A thick layer of dusty ash and loose sediment appears to cover this part of the ground. The craft might be able to land here but it may be risky.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow8 = The terrain appears mostly flat, but the occasional cliff or mountain appears out of nowhere to disturb this theme.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow9 = Patches of smooth, brown basalt rock finally interrupt the jagged cliffs and layers of loose sediment. They're probably the best place to land.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow10 = From here, the terrain appears to be as calm as it's going to get. It's saddening that the safest place to land will likely avoid the beautiful view of the lava oceans.

	// Defs for Eespeyeria:
	#LOC_CH_Eespeyeria_displayName = Eespeyeria^N
	#LOC_CH_Eespeyeria_description = Eespeyeria has a very dense atmopshere for a moon of this mass. Readings show a very eroded landscape with lakes of hydrocarbons.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	// Defs for Gaia:
	#LOC_CH_Gaia_displayName = Gaia^N
	#LOC_CH_Gaia_description = Being the outermost body in the Harmonia system, Gaia is famous for its unique properties, a dense enough atomsphere for aerobreaking, an icy composition (perfect for ice cream) and a ressourceful companion, Po.

	#LOC_CH_Gaia_biomeDisplayName_DeepRegions = Deep Regions

	// Defs for Kreak:
	#LOC_CH_Kreak_displayName = Kreak^N
	#LOC_CH_Kreak_description = Kreak is an icy moon, so icy that most of its surface is covered in ice, except for some mountains raising above the ice levels. Probably also tastes delicious.

	#LOC_CH_Kreak_biomeDisplayName_Plains = Plains
	#LOC_CH_Kreak_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	// Defs for Krob:
	#LOC_CH_Krob_displayName = Krob^N
	#LOC_CH_Krob_description = Only true moon of the Sanctar-Alia system, the coloration was originally thought to be ice cream, unfortunately its close proximity to Harmonia makes it impossible.

	#LOC_CH_Krob_biomeDisplayName_ErodedValley = Eroded Valleys
	#LOC_CH_Krob_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Krob_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
	// Defs for Magnifica:
	#LOC_CH_Magnifica_displayName = Magnifica^N
	#LOC_CH_Magnifica_description = The sole gas giant in the Harmonia system, it was named Magnifica due to the discoverer being completely baffled by the grape candy in the sky.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	// Defs for Majesty:
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_displayName = Majesty^N
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_description = Majesty is the only moon of Aklarka. The nature of its parent planet makes Majesty a nice pit stop for whoever tries to go and return from Aklarkas surface. Majesty agglomerate some material in the rings, creating a gap. Jumping from the giant cliff looks very fun !

	#LOC_CH_Majesty_biomeDisplayName_FluvialValley = Fluvial Valley
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_biomeDisplayName_Plains = Plains
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands

	// Defs for Po:
	#LOC_CH_Po_displayName = Po^N
	#LOC_CH_Po_description = Po is the sole companion of Gaia, together alone at the edge of the system. This time it actually might have ice cream on it!

	#LOC_CH_Po_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Po_biomeDisplayName_YoungImpactCraters = Young Impact Craters
	#LOC_CH_Po_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands

	#LOC_CH_Po_biomeDisplayName_NitrogenDepot = Nitrogen Depot

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	// Defs for Pobos:
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_displayName = Pobos^N
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_description = Pobos is the innermost moon of Magnifica, it is very small and theorized to be a clump of ring material or being the remnant of an old broken moon that made the rings. Some says that it ressembles a primate skull.
		
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_biomeDisplayName_Midlands = Midlands
	#LOC_CH_Pobos_biomeDisplayName_Highlands = Highlands

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// Defs for Sanctar
	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_displayName = Sanctar^N
	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_description = Sanctar is a very welcoming world, falling upon it is extremely luck as it is apart of a binary system. Its sister, Alia, has very similar properties. Those qualities made Sanctar the number one candidate for kerbal immigration after they lost their home due to unfortunate events.

	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_biomeDisplayName_Waters = Ocean

	// Defs for Trom
	#LOC_CH_Trom_displayName = Trom^N
	#LOC_CH_Trom_description = Trom is an egg shaped ringed dwarf planet, its original discovery made the scientists quite hungry for an omelette. Some believe it to be a Kraken egg. Kraken egg or not, Trom is an interesting destination.

	// Defs for Valheilheim
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_displayName = Valheilheim^N
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_description = Valheilheim is the desert planet of the Harmonia system. This planet has very small rings and a huge plain, most probably due to a *recent* cataclysmic event, such as a collision. This place would be great to shoot some movies !

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_biomeDisplayName_ApocalypseDesert = Apocalypse Desert
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_biomeDisplayName_Dunes = Dunes
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_biomeDisplayName_Lowlands = Lowlands

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_biomeDisplayName_Poles = Poles


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert1 = You lean down and take a sample of the sand. It's getting everywhere! Little crevices in the suit are filled with dust.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert2 = After taking a sample from the surface, you cap the tube. Tightly. Else the sand gets absolutely everywhere. 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert3 = Taking a surface sample from Valheilheim is quite easy. In fact, you have to try quite hard to get rid of the sand from your spacesuit and ship.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Dunes1 = You get on the ground and scoop up some dirt. Here, you get some rocks as well.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Dunes2 = This area seems to be a bit more rocky. You bend down and pop a few into a sample tube. The scientists back on Sanctar are gonna love this! 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Dunes3 = The rocks here are a very nice shade of golden-brown. You stare at the surface, thinking how beautiful this planet is.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Lowlands1 = The ground here reminds you of Duna, but not so red. A tear flows as you drop down to get a sample.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Lowlands2 = The scientists back at Mission Control instruct you to be careful with these samples. Apparently this area may contain water!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Lowlands3 = The soil here is very loose at the surface, but gets stiffer deeper down. We may need a sample drill for deeper core samples.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Midlands1 = The surface here is harder, requiring the sample drill to collect. The fine dust appears to be a very beautiful shade of golden-brown.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Midlands2 = After drilling through the surface, you collect samples. The scientists back home instruct you to get multiple samples from different depths.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Midlands3 = While waiting for the drill to make it's way through the surface, you think about Valheilheim. What happened here? Did life ever exist here? More science will tell.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Highlands1 = The surface seems to get harder the higher you go. The drill is really struggling here. The knowledge we get from this sand will be worth it though!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Highlands2 = The drill is overheating. You set it aside to cool down, making sure to check for any sensitive hardware nearby.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Highlands3 = The powderizing bit is too much for your drill. You switch to a coring bit, which helps. The scientists back home will probably be happier anyway with a cylinder of Valheilheim.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Mountains1 = Getting samples from mountains is a good idea, because if the planet had water at one point, the mountain might have been underwater and then have been pushed up. The drill is really struggling though.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Mountains2 = The drill is overheating. What is this planet made out of, titanium? You sigh and watch as the drill cools down slowly, and then continue getting a sample.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Mountains3 = From the data we're getting from the suit's builtin soil analyser, we can see trace amounts of organics! We need more thorough scientific experimentation on this though.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_MountCeleste1 = proxima write def wen
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_MountCeleste2 = still waiting for proksima
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_MountCeleste3 = proksima release actual quality content wen

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Poles1 = The poles of planets usually have some ice, but here it's sand. Again. You bend down, scoop it up, and get it off your gloves.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Poles2 = Sand from the poles seems a bit different than the other samples. Maybe the poles used to have ice? We can't tell for sure until we send this back to Sanctar.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Poles3 = The scientists back home think that getting sand from all the biomes of Valheilheim is "easy". That's easy to say when you aren't the one having to actually collect it though.


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_ApocalypseDesert1 = You clamber out of the ship and look around. Not much other than sand, rocks, and more sand. The sand gets in little crevices in your spacesuit, and jams up the joints. A better suit is probably needed for long-term exploration here
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_ApocalypseDesert2 = After getting out of the hatch, you look around. Seems to be just sand. Why did we choose to land in the desert again?
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_ApocalypseDesert3 = The sand gets *everywhere*! Any small holes are completely filled. The sand seems to be sentient as well, since it chooses to jam up the sensing probes first.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Dunes1 = Finally, there is something to look at other than sand. There appear to be small rocks dotted around. We should probably pick them up and take them home with us.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Dunes2 = This seems to be quite a nice place! It is not quite as sandy as the desert, and has a few rocks as well. The scientists back at mission control will love these rocks!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Dunes3 = You get out of the hatch, and walk out on the dusty surface of Valheilheim. You stare out, pondering questions like "Am I alone here?", "Was there ever life here?"

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Lowlands1 = You hum "Life On Valheilheim" by David Kerman as you get out of the hatch. More science will tell if that song refers to life other than kerbals.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Lowlands2 = The surface is dusty at the top, but gets harder lower down. It makes for an interesting surface to walk on! The color of the sand has changed as well, becoming a bit lighter.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Lowlands3 = The surface is definitely lighter here. Maybe the intense light of Harmonia hasn't cooked it a lot, compared to the desert.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Midlands1 = The surface is quite hard here. You feel as though you are walking on a tiled floor. We should probably get a surface sample and analyse it.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Midlands2 = The atmosphere is a beautiful golden-brown. The surface is a beautiful golden-brown. Everything on this planet is golden-brown. This entire planet is beautiful.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Midlands3 = This is one of the best spots on this planet to get a photo session done. We can log this as "scientific activity" so we can use the fancy science camera we brought.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Highlands1 = 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Highlands2 = 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Highlands3 = 

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Mountains1 = Finding a flat spot to land wasn't wasy, but we did it. Mission Control says that this area might have been underwater at one point, so if any life did live on Valheilheim, this would be a good place to find it.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Mountains2 = The terrain here is a bit tough to navigate, however we can get a good view of the rest of Valheilheim. This area is also rich with telltale signs of organics!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Mountains3 = Mountains are not easy to navigate, and this one is certainly no exception. The surface has a bunch of loose rocks, which can slip under your feet at any point.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_MountCeleste1 = no signs of intelligent life anywhere
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_MountCeleste2 = still waiting for proxy-ma
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_MountCeleste3 = proxima proksima proxy-ma proxcima 

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Poles1 = The surface seems oddly slippery. Maybe there is frozen-something underneath, covered with a layer of sand? Further experimentation is required.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Poles2 = Look ma, I'm on the top of the world! Or bottom! We can't really tell without looking at our instruments.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_Poles3 = This place looks the same as the rest of Valheilheim, but it doesn't behave the same. Something tells me that there is more to the poles than what can be observed.
