# CelestialHarmonyConfigs

A set of modified configs for ProximaCentauri's planet pack for KSP. Science blurbs are added, as well as a localisation file for easy translation and editing. 

After downloading and unzipping, move everything inside the `configs` folder into `CelestialHarmony/_Systems/Harmonia/Configs`. Say yes to overwriting files.

For a stable, guaranteed-working set of configs, download the latest release. If you want the latest configs, hit `Download Code`. These may not always work, but they are the latest.
