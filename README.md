# CelestialHarmonyConfigs

A set of modified configs for ProximaCentauri's planet pack for KSP. Science blurbs are added, as well as a localisation file for easy translation and editing. 

After downloading and unzipping, move everything inside the `configs` folder into `CelestialHarmony/_Systems/Harmonia/Configs`. Say yes to overwriting files.

## Suggestions

### Vallheilheim
Surface sample for Vallheilheim's apocalypse should have something to do with Anakin's hate for sand, maybe something about sand getting in equipment or the kerbal's feet sinking in sand
