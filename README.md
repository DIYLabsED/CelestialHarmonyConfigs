# CelestialHarmonyConfigs

A set of modified configs for ProximaCentauri's planet pack for KSP. Science blurbs are added, as well as a localisation file for easy translation and editing. 

After downloading and unzipping, move everything inside the `configs` folder into `CelestialHarmony/_Systems/Harmonia/Configs`. Say yes to overwriting files.
